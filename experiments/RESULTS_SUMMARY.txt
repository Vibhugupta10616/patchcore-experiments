## 🎯 Key Insights

1. **Vision Transformer backbones outperform CNNs**
   - DINOv2 and CLIP are ~2-3% better than ResNet50

2. **Domain shift is significant**
   - Cross-domain performance drops 19% compared to in-domain
   - Suggests need for domain adaptation techniques

3. **Adaptive fusion is optimal**
   - Adaptive strategy is 4% better than single-layer baseline
   - Worth the added complexity
